You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to understand and adhere to the Rules and Code of Conduct.</p><p><strong>i. Community Rules of Conduct</strong></p><p>The terms listed below are not all-inclusive, and are subject to change without notice. Exceptions to these Guidelines may be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on what is in the best interests of the community as a whole.<br>1. Play nice. Do not personally attack another poster. Don’t try to make another user’s life difficult. If you disagree with an opinion or idea, there is no reason to become hostile.</p><p>2. Keep it clean. Posts containing vulgar, obscene, or otherwise generally unacceptable material will be summarily removed and a warning will be issued. This includes any material that can be construed as racist or illegal, and covers racial slang/pornography/copyright violations/etc. In addition, for the benefit of all, no discussion on religion and politics will be allowed. Direct links to any of the above count as well, as do attempts to sneak around the censor filter.</p><p>3. Do not discuss topics that are in direct violation of a game’s Terms of Use or EULA. This also includes discussion in violation of any Non Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) a title or player may be under.</p><p>4. No trolling allowed. While the basic idea of just what trolling is can vary from case to case, it is generally accepted that trolling is posting in a manner intended to anger or insult another poster or posters. Behavior of this sort is frowned upon and will be dealt with accordingly.</p><p>5. Do post constructively. Any posts that do not provide any substance to the discussion, or the community as a whole, will be removed. This includes advertising/spam, abuse of the color/size tags, spamming nothing but smiley faces, abusing the quote function, posting without using the search function first, ranting in every thread, etc. Also messages consisting of posting in a manner that could be considered “baiting” of another poster.</p><p>6. Please keep posts related to the topic at hand. While some discussions will naturally morph into related topics, purposefully derailing a conversation will not be tolerated.</p><p>7. Moderators’ or Guest Service Representatives’ decisions are not to be publically discussed – likewise for service correspondence without explicit permission from the staff member. Should you have a comment, concern, question or issue, use the private message feature to contact a moderator or administrator. Furthermore, if you believe a post or thread to be in violation of these rules, either in whole or in part, use the report function on said post or thread or contact a moderator privately. In addition, altering or editing a staff member’s message or post edit is also forbidden.</p><p>8. Private messages shall be kept private unless a user has expressedly written consent of the author of said message(s) to publicly post the information contained therein.</p><p>9.

For exploits and other such cheats, please make immediate use of the support ticket system.</p><p>10. No account hopping to evade suspension or other such penalties. You are personally responsible for your conduct on the forums and in game. If you create a new account to continue bad behavior because another account was suspended, any accounts involved will be permanently revoked.
